# Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered,
usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant
or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable
to create such a suffix

# Rules:

# 1. For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial
 vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added for example:
# "pig" = "igpay"
# "latin" = "atinlay"
# "banana" = "ananabay"
# "will" = "illway"
# "butler" = "utlerbay"
# "happy" = "appyhay"
# "duck" = "uckday"
# "me" = "emay"

# 2. For words that begin with vowel sounds, the vowel is left alone, and most
 commonly 'yay' is added to the end. But in different parts of the world, there
 are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or just 'ay' or
 other endings. Examples are:

# "eat" = "eatyay" or "eatay"
# "omelet" = "omeletyay" or "omeletay"
# "are" = "areyay" or "areay"
# "egg" = "eggyay" or "eggay"
# "explain" = "explainyay"
# "always" = "alwaysyay" or "alwaysay"
# "ends" = "endsyay" or "endsay"
# "honest" = "honestyay"
# "I"= "Iyay"

# 3. When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound),
 the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.

# "smile" = "ilesmay"
# "string" = "ingstray"
# "stupid" = "upidstay"
# "glove" = "oveglay"
# "trash" = "ashtray"
# "floor"= "oorflay"
# "store"= "orestay"

# 4. An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes
 the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This
 usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant
 of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the
 converted words. Examples are:

# "every" = "eryevay"
# "another" = "otheranay"
# "under" = "erunday"
# "island" = "andislay"
# "elegant" = "egantelay"

Pig latin program Design
1. Prompt user to enter an English text for translation to pig latin and store
the text in a variable

2. Have a constant to hold a tuple of lowercase vowel sounds (including 'y')

3. create a list of words from the text entered

4. create a list to store the new words after translation to pig latin

5. for every word;
 i.) remove any non-alphabet character that comes before and after the word and
  store these in variables to be added back later

 ii.) store the state of the word i.e if it was uppercase, or capitalized so that
  it can be restored back to that state later

 iii.) convert the word to lowercase for translation

6. Translate each word using the pig latin language rules
 i.) If word begins with a consonant sound, remove any consonant sounds at the
  beginning of the word and store them in a variable, then add that consonant
  sound plus 'ay' at the end of the word to form the translated version
 ii.) If word begins with a vowel sound, add 'yay' at the end of the word to
 form the translated version

7. convert word back to it's original state if it was uppercase or capitalized

8. Add the word plus any removed non-alphabet characters to the list that holds
the translated words

9. join the translated words back to form a new text in pig latin
